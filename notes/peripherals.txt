peripherals
	RESET
		already has an internal 50kOhm pull-up resistor
		optional: external 10kOhm pull-up resistor for noisy environments
		optional: ESD protection diode to clamp in case of VRESET > VCC
	VCC
		connect to 5V
		decouple using 100nF ceramic capacitor
	AVCC
		connect to 5V
		if using the ADC, decouple using 100nF ceramic capacitor
	AREF
		if using the ADC, connect to reference voltage
		if using the ADC, decouple using 100nF ceramic capacitor
	XTAL
		place oscillator as close to MCU as possible
		surround oscillator with ground plane
