storage
	sram: volatile data
		contains things that change often and do not have to be preserved
	eeprom: non-volatile data
		contains things that change often but have to be preserved
	flash: static data
		can be exploited at compile time
		does not require code for run time handling
		contains things that change very rarely
	if something depends on the hardware configuration, it should probably be stored in flash
